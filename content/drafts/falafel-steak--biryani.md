I've been a bit slack in updating this blog recently, so in the last three weeks I've made three different things.

## Falafel Burgers

I didn't make the falafel for these, so it didn't take very long to make. They taste pretty healthy, and I would recommend cooking some mushrooms as an additional filling.

## Sirloin Steak

There's not much to say about this. Steak with a garlic marinade, rice & bok choy. Tastes fine, but I personally find steak boring.

## Lamb Biryani

This dish was quick to make, and the result was pretty good. However, I would double the amount of rice & stock, or else the dish is mostly meat.
