The [Overnight Sensation
MTM](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/overnightsensationmtm) is a
speaker designed by [Paul
Carmody](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/). It is the larger version
of the Overnight Sensation and is very popular in the DIY audio community.

I haven't had much experience with wood working before, so this project is
going to be a fun challenge.

## Day 0: Ordering Parts

It is possible to order a full kit that includes the cabinet pre-cut, and only
requires gluing together. This saves a lot of time and effort.

However, I live in New Zealand, and shipping costs a lot. Especially when it's
large and heavy (like a flat-pack kit of 3/8" MDF board).

So, I decided to build the kit myself. At the time of writing this, I've
spent more on tools then it would have cost me to just order the pre-cut
boards, but I feel like I've learnt more. Also, if I ever decide to make
another speaker in the future, I'll only need to purchase the wood.

I ordered most of the parts from [Parts Express](http://www.parts-express.com).
However, they didn't have the model of tweeter I needed in stock, so I ordered
that from [The Loudspeaker
Kit](http://www.theloudspeakerkit.com/dayton-audio-nd20fa-6-3-4-neodymium-dome-tweeter).
They also didn't have any 10uF non-polarised electrolytic capacitors in stock,
so I picked those up from my local [Jaycar](http://www.jaycar.co.nz/p/RY6908).

## Day 1: Planning

![Paul Carmody's original design plans](/assets/osmtm/plans.jpg)

There are cabinet design plans for 1/2" and 3/4" MDF. However, I only have
access to 18mm MDF, which is a just a millimetre thinner than 3/4". In order to
maintain the same internal volume, I calculated my own sizes.

Internal dimensions:

- 368mm high
- 114mm wide
- 216mm deep

External dimensions (with 18mm MDF):

- 404mm high
- 150mm wide
- 252mm deep

I used the 2D cutting optimizer at
[optimalon.com](http://optimalon.com/online_cut_optimizer.htm) to plan out what size MDF
boards I would need to purchase. I ended choosing 2x 1800x300x18 boards.

I wanted to rebate the edges of the boards so they join together nicely. I did
plenty of sketches to figure out what cuts I needed to make.

[![](/assets/osmtm/planning-1.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/planning-1.jpg)

I used SketchUp to double check that I had all the dimensions correct and that
my rebate joins were the right size.

## Day 2: Cutting

I started by roughly cutting the boards in half using a circular saw.

[![](/assets/osmtm/cutting-2.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/cutting-2.jpg))

I, with help from Dad, used a radial-arm saw to cut the boards into the correct
dimensions. We made sure the saw was cutting at 90Ëš by doing a few cuts on a
bit of scrap.

It took a while to make all the cuts. The front, back, and sides, which were
just a little bit longer than what the saw could reach, needed to be spun
around to finish off the cut.

## Day 3: The Router

I spent the morning shopping for a Router and the necessary cutting bits.

I needed a router to cut the holes for midwoofer and tweeter, as well as to
rebate the edges.

I ended purchasing the Black & Decker KW900EKA Plunge Router, as well as an
18mm straight cutter, a flush trim cutter, and a 10mm rebate cutter.

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-2.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-2.jpg))

I used the flush trim cutter to clean up any inconsistances between the tops,
bottoms, sides and backs.

The 10mm rebate cutter was also used to cut a 10x8mm rebate on the side boards.
I also needed to cut an 8x8mm rebate, but at that time I hadn't figured out how
I was going to do that.

## Day 4: More Routing

I needed to cut an 8mm rebate with only a 10mm rebate cutter, so I made a
simple jig for the router to slide across, at the just the right distance. It
was a bit slow to setup, but it worked ok.

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-3.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-3.jpg)

I then needed to cut a channel in the side and back panels to hold the brace. I
used the included fence attachment to cut a parallel 18mm groove.

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-4.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-4.jpg)

All the panels laid out:

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-5.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-5.jpg)

I fitted all the panels together (without glue), just to check that I hadn't
made any mistakes with the measurements. Overall I was quite impressed, though
it was wider by about 1.5mm than I had planned for, so I'm going to measure
everything and find out what I need to trim down.

## Day 5: DIY Router Table

It rained nearly all day today, so I didn't have much of a chance to finish off
the routing.

I took a trip down to Bunnings and picked up six cheap quick-release clamps,
which I'll need when I glue the cabinets together. I also bought some quality
PVA glue, a couple dust masks, and some vernier calipers for precision
measuring.

I used the calipers to check how accurate I was with my routing, and found that
I was short a millimetre in some places. I needed a more accurate way to rebate
the panels, so I decided I was going to turn my plunge router into a router
table.

I wanted something cheap, simple and portable. I found [this wood working
article](http://www.finewoodworking.com/item/11120/free-plan-how-to-build-a-simple-router-table)
with plans for building exactly what I wanted.

[![](/assets/osmtm/table-plans.jpg)](http://www.finewoodworking.com/FWNPDFfree/minimalist-router-table-free-plan.pdf)

I started by finding four bolts that would fit into the bottom of my router, as
the ones it comes with aren't long enough to go through a thick piece of wood.

I traced around the bottom of the router, and setup a temporary jig about 6mm
from the edge. Why 6mm? Because I was going to use the included router guide
bush with the jig, and it happens to be 6mm from the edge of the collet to the
edge of the cutter.

[![](/assets/osmtm/table-1.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/table-1.jpg)

I cut about 9mm into the board, so that I would have about 21mm left. Doing
this gives me a bit more height on the cutter bit, and also so I don't have to
find some longer bolts.

While trying to cut out middle of the hole, the router accidentally slipped off
the jig and gouged the bottom of the board. Next time, I just do as much as I
can, and then finish with a chisel.

[![](/assets/osmtm/table-2.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/table-2.jpg)

I marked screw holes, and drilled them out. So far, so good.

[![](/assets/osmtm/table-3.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/table-3.jpg)

I flipped the board over, and counter sunk the holes, just enough so that
the bolts wouldn't stick out.

I used a hole saw and a rasp to cut out the hole for cutter. I then flipped the
board over again, and attached the router. 

[![](/assets/osmtm/table-4.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/table-4.jpg)

I flipped the board back over, so that the router was on the bottom.
That's the hard part done.

[![](/assets/osmtm/table-5.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/table-5.jpg)

I found a piece of wood to use as the fence, and drilled a hole through one
side, large enough for a bolt. Then I marked out where wood hits the cutter,
and cut out hole large enough for the cutter to sit.

I gave it a quick test, and found that it worked pretty well. All that I need
to do now is use some tape to keep the power button on the router pressed, so I
don't have to keep one my hand on it all the time.

[![](/assets/osmtm/table-6.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/table-6.jpg)

The great thing about this setup is that I can simply unclamp it from the
table, and move it around, or bring it inside for storage.
