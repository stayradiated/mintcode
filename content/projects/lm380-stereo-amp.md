In preparation for building the LM3886 amplifier, I wanted to create a simpler,
cheaper amplifier.

After a bit of research online, I found the LM380 chipamp and [this blog post
by x2jiggy](http://www.x2jiggy.com/blog/2014/4/14/lm380-stereo-amplifier).
While I wouldn't be creating the case out of MDF and popsicle sticks, the
information about the circuit schematic was very helpful.

## The Components

All the components were bought from my local Jaycar store on a Saturday
afternoon. It was quite fun searching through the hundreds of boxes looking for
a specific part - luckily I had the forethought to write down the product
numbers from Jaycars website.
