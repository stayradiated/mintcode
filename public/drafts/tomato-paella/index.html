  <p>Tomatoes were pretty cheap this week, so I decided to do something with the many fresh tomatoes we had (that wasn&rsquo;t a salad).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had a Paella in my life, so I decided to try and make it. I found <a href="http://pinchmysalt.com/tomato-paella-with-chorizo/">this recipe</a> and did minimal ingredient subsitution. The only thing that changed was the substitution of chorizo for bacon. There&rsquo;s also saffron in this dish, which is the most expensive substance on the planet - I think it just helps adds colour as it doesn&rsquo;t really smell or taste like much.</p>

</p>

<p>The whole process was relatively simple. Everything just has to be fried up on the stove before adding the tomatoes on top and roasting it in the oven. The final result was fantastic and is probably up there with the best rice dishes out there. It&rsquo;s also a great way to use fresh tomatoes without chopping them all up and making sauce.</p>
