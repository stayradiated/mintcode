Before Term Kitchen there was a severe lack of terminal colour scheme editors
available. People would need to spend hours copy/pasting hex codes into their
text editor. Finding new schemes required editing of term configs before you
could see how the scheme looked. Themes were shared using the terminal specific
configuration which was time consuming to get working in another terminal
emulator.

Term Kitchen solves all these problems and more.
