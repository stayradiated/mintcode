<p>The <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/overnightsensationmtm">Overnight Sensation
MTM</a> is a
speaker designed by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/">Paul
Carmody</a>. It is the larger version
of the Overnight Sensation and is very popular in the DIY audio community.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had much experience with wood working before, so this project is
going to be a fun challenge.</p>

<h2 id="day-0-ordering-parts:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 0: Ordering Parts</h2>

<p>It is possible to order a full kit that includes the cabinet pre-cut, and only
requires gluing together. This saves a lot of time and effort.</p>

<p>However, I live in New Zealand, and shipping costs a lot. Especially when it&rsquo;s
large and heavy (like a flat-pack kit of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; MDF board).</p>

<p>So, I decided to build the kit myself. At the time of writing this, I&rsquo;ve
spent more on tools then it would have cost me to just order the pre-cut
boards, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve learnt more. Also, if I ever decide to make
another speaker in the future, I&rsquo;ll only need to purchase the wood.</p>

<p>I ordered most of the parts from <a href="http://www.parts-express.com">Parts Express</a>.
However, they didn&rsquo;t have the model of tweeter I needed in stock, so I ordered
that from <a href="http://www.theloudspeakerkit.com/dayton-audio-nd20fa-6-3-4-neodymium-dome-tweeter">The Loudspeaker
Kit</a>.
They also didn&rsquo;t have any 10uF non-polarised electrolytic capacitors in stock,
so I picked those up from my local <a href="http://www.jaycar.co.nz/p/RY6908">Jaycar</a>.</p>

<h2 id="day-1-planning:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 1: Planning</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/osmtm/plans.jpg" alt="Paul Carmody's original design plans" />
</p>

<p>There are cabinet design plans for <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; MDF. However, I only have
access to 18mm MDF, which is a just a millimetre thinner than <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;. In order to
maintain the same internal volume, I calculated my own sizes.</p>

<p>Internal dimensions:</p>

<ul>
<li>368mm high</li>
<li>114mm wide</li>
<li>216mm deep</li>
</ul>

<p>External dimensions (with 18mm MDF):</p>

<ul>
<li>404mm high</li>
<li>150mm wide</li>
<li>252mm deep</li>
</ul>

<p>I used the 2D cutting optimizer at
<a href="http://optimalon.com/online_cut_optimizer.htm">optimalon.com</a> to plan out what size MDF
boards I would need to purchase. I ended choosing 2x 1800x300x18 boards.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/osmtm/cuts.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>I wanted to rebate the edges of the boards so they join together nicely. I did
plenty of sketches to figure out what cuts I needed to make.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/planning-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/planning-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I used SketchUp to double check that I had all the dimensions correct and that
my rebate joins were the right size.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/sketchup.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/sketchup.jpg" alt="" />
</a>)</p>

<h2 id="day-2-cutting:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 2: Cutting</h2>

<p>I started by roughly cutting the boards in half using a circular saw.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/cutting-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/cutting-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a>)
<a href="/assets/osmtm/full/cutting-2.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/cutting-2.jpg" alt="" />
</a>)</p>

<p>I, with help from Dad, used a radial-arm saw to cut the boards into the correct
dimensions. We made sure the saw was cutting at 90Ëš by doing a few cuts on a
bit of scrap.</p>

<p>It took a while to make all the cuts. The front, back, and sides, which were
just a little bit longer than what the saw could reach, needed to be spun
around to finish off the cut.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/cutting-3.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/cutting-3.jpg" alt="" />
</a>)
<a href="/assets/osmtm/full/cutting-4.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/cutting-4.jpg" alt="" />
</a>)</p>

<h2 id="day-3-the-router:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 3: The Router</h2>

<p>I spent the morning shopping for a Router and the necessary cutting bits.</p>

<p>I needed a router to cut the holes for midwoofer and tweeter, as well as to
rebate the edges.</p>

<p>I ended purchasing the Black &amp; Decker KW900EKA Plunge Router, as well as an
18mm straight cutter, a flush trim cutter, and a 10mm rebate cutter.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/router-2.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/router-2.jpg" alt="" />
</a>)</p>

<p>I used the flush trim cutter to clean up any inconsistances between the tops,
bottoms, sides and backs.</p>

<p>The 10mm rebate cutter was also used to cut a 10x8mm rebate on the side boards.
I also needed to cut an 8x8mm rebate, but at that time I hadn&rsquo;t figured out how
I was going to do that.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/router-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/router-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<h2 id="day-4-more-routing:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 4: More Routing</h2>

<p>I needed to cut an 8mm rebate with only a 10mm rebate cutter, so I made a
simple jig for the router to slide across, at the just the right distance. It
was a bit slow to setup, but it worked ok.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/router-3.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/router-3.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I then needed to cut a channel in the side and back panels to hold the brace. I
used the included fence attachment to cut a parallel 18mm groove.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/router-4.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/router-4.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>All the panels laid out:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/router-5.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/router-5.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I fitted all the panels together (without glue), just to check that I hadn&rsquo;t
made any mistakes with the measurements. Overall I was quite impressed, though
it was wider by about 1.5mm than I had planned for, so I&rsquo;m going to measure
everything and find out what I need to trim down.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/router-6.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/router-6.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<h2 id="day-5-diy-router-table:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 5: DIY Router Table</h2>

<p>It rained nearly all day today, so I didn&rsquo;t have much of a chance to finish off
the routing.</p>

<p>I took a trip down to Bunnings and picked up six cheap quick-release clamps,
which I&rsquo;ll need when I glue the cabinets together. I also bought some quality
PVA glue, a couple dust masks, and some vernier calipers for precision
measuring.</p>

<p>I used the calipers to check how accurate I was with my routing, and found that
I was short a millimetre in some places. I needed a more accurate way to rebate
the panels, so I decided I was going to turn my plunge router into a router
table.</p>

<p>I wanted something cheap, simple and portable. I found <a href="http://www.finewoodworking.com/item/11120/free-plan-how-to-build-a-simple-router-table">this wood working
article</a>
with plans for building exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finewoodworking.com/FWNPDFfree/minimalist-router-table-free-plan.pdf"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-plans.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I started by finding four bolts that would fit into the bottom of my router, as
the ones it comes with aren&rsquo;t long enough to go through a thick piece of wood.</p>

<p>I traced around the bottom of the router, and setup a temporary jig about 6mm
from the edge. Why 6mm? Because I was going to use the included router guide
bush with the jig, and it happens to be 6mm from the edge of the collet to the
edge of the cutter.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I cut about 9mm into the board, so that I would have about 21mm left. Doing
this gives me a bit more height on the cutter bit, and also so I don&rsquo;t have to
find some longer bolts.</p>

<p>While trying to cut out middle of the hole, the router accidentally slipped off
the jig and gouged the bottom of the board. Next time, I just do as much as I
can, and then finish with a chisel.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-2.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-2.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I marked screw holes, and drilled them out. So far, so good.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-3.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-3.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I flipped the board over, and counter sunk the holes, just enough so that
the bolts wouldn&rsquo;t stick out.</p>

<p>I used a hole saw and a rasp to cut out the hole for cutter. I then flipped the
board over again, and attached the router.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-4.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-4.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I flipped the board back over, so that the router was on the bottom.
That&rsquo;s the hard part done.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-5.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-5.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I found a piece of wood to use as the fence, and drilled a hole through one
side, large enough for a bolt. Then I marked out where wood hits the cutter,
and cut out hole large enough for the cutter to sit.</p>

<p>I gave it a quick test, and found that it worked pretty well. All that I need
to do now is use some tape to keep the power button on the router pressed, so I
don&rsquo;t have to keep one my hand on it all the time.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-6.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-6.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>The great thing about this setup is that I can simply unclamp it from the
table, and move it around, or bring it inside for storage.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-7.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-7.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<h2 id="day-6-routing-glueing:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 6: Routing &amp; Glueing</h2>

<p>To finish off the router table, I needed an easy way to be able to switch the
router on and off. I used several rubber bands to keep the router button
depressed, and a power strip to turn the router on.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-8.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-8.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I clamped the board to the table with a wooden stake so I the clamps wouldn&rsquo;t
get in the way. I clamped the vacuum right next to the router to minimize the
amount of dust.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-9.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-9.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>In case the board wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to hold the router, I stacked up some
scrap wood underneath it. This was also useful when I needed to adjust the
plunge depth, as I could use the wood to hold the router in place while I
tweaked the depth.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-10.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-10.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I ended up needing to cut another hole in my fence, as the first one I made was
too wide, and it made cutting smaller pieces difficult.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/table-11.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/table-11.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>Later on in the day I started to glue the cabinet together. I did a test fit
before to make sure all the panels fit together properly.</p>

<p>I prepared by putting plenty of newspaper down, and getting a damp cloth ready
to wipe off excess glue.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/glue-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I started with one corner, clamping it for half an hour, and then doing another
corner. I left the cabinet clamped overnight, for maximum strength.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-2.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/glue-2.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<h2 id="day-7-glueing-bracing:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 7: Glueing &amp; Bracing</h2>

<p>The first cabinet I glued was finished, and I was quite impressed by how strong
it feels.</p>

<p>I glued the second cabinet, this time doing two corners at a time to speed up
the process.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-3.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/glue-3.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll need to do a bit of sanding, but overall I think the glueing went pretty
well. The brace and back panel are not glued in yet.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-4.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/glue-4.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>The Dayton tweeters arrived. They were a bit smaller than I
expected, probably because I was assuming that would be similar to the HiVi T-20
that
<a href="http://meniscusaudio.com/overnight-sensation-pair-p-1243.html">meniscus.com</a>
offers.</p>

<p>The diameter of hole needed to mount the tweeter is 33mm.
The flange around it has a diameter of 45mm and is 2.25mm thick.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/tweeter-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/tweeter-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>Time to cut the brace supports with a jigsaw.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/brace-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>My jigsawing skills aren&rsquo;t the greatest, but it doesn&rsquo;t too much, as you will
not be able to see the brace once it&rsquo;s installed.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-2.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/brace-2.jpg" alt="" />
</a>
<a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-3.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/brace-3.jpg" alt="" />
</a>
<a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-4.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/brace-4.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I gave the edges a quick sand to smooth them a bit. Not at all necessary, but
it might make installing the midwoofer and tweeter a bit nicer.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-5.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/brace-5.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>Here is how the braces look installed in the cabinets. I haven&rsquo;t glued them in
yet. I think I&rsquo;ll wait until the rest of the parts arrive.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/glue-6.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/brace-6.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<h2 id="day-8-diy-circle-jig:b331d4a120d9e29602d269a80b3ea1e5">Day 8: DIY Circle Jig</h2>

<p>It rained again today. The parts are still in transit, so there wasn&rsquo;t much to
do except build the circle jig so I can cut cicles with the router.</p>

<p>I went with a design I saw on <a href="https://youtu.be/b37LyYIO0sA?list=PLe27g672GxSaAMvcp8t5OI3Mzyg3m-GfY">Richard Morley&rsquo;s YouTube
Channel</a>
where the center point is fixed and the router slides back and forth on rails.</p>

<p>I started by marking out what I needed on some spare hardboard. I then cut out
the pieces using a jigsaw.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-1.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>To make the jig a bit stronger, and because the only thick washer I could find
was thicker than a single piece of board, I decided to glue two pieces
together.</p>

<p>I then drilled a hole for the washer.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-2.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-2.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>The washer is used to protect the wood from being eroded when it rotates around
the center bolt.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-3.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-3.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I then used the radial-arm saw to square up the edges.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-5.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-5.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I gave the edges a quick sanding to make them a bit smoother.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-4.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-4.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>To make the rails for the router, I first drilled holes at one end, then used
my table router to cut a straight line.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-6.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-6.jpg" alt="" />
</a>
<a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-7.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-7.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I then used a larger cutter to cut out channels a couple millimeters deep so
that a washer could fit in there.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-8.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-8.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I found a couple old washers that were the right size.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-9.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-9.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t cut the channels deep enough to cover for the washer and
the head of the bolt. By this time I had already disassembled my table router,
so I&rsquo;ll probably fix this tomorrow.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-10.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-10.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I attached the router to the circle jig, and cut the center rail for the cutter
bit to go through.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-12.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-12.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>It was getting quite dark, so I decided to give it quick test before packing
up. I found a bit of scrap MDF and drilled a hole so I could fit a bolt through
it.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-13.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-13.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>I then fit the router with the circle jig attached over the bolt. Tomorrow,
I might cut the bolt down a bit, as I&rsquo;ll need to cut circles where the bolt
will be under the router.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-14.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-14.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>The result was pretty decent.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-11.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-11.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>The finished circle jig. Just need to make the channels a little deeper.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/osmtm/full/circle-15.jpg"><img src="/assets/osmtm/circle-15.jpg" alt="" />
