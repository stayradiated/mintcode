  <p>I don&rsquo;t really like chicken, but there was a bunch of chicken that needed to be used so I just made the <a href="/beef-rendang/">same as last week</a>. The recipe didn&rsquo;t really change at all, and while it turned out to be ok, it was certanily better with the beef.</p>

</p>

<p>I also managed to mistake the very spicy chili from the market for the very mild chili that grows in the garden. Needless to say, it was a bit on the hot side. While the dish today was still delicious, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend chicken.</p>
