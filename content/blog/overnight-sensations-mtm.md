The [Overnight Sensation
MTM](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/overnightsensationmtm) is a
speaker designed by [Paul
Carmody](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/). It is the larger version
of the Overnight Sensation and is very popular in the DIY audio community.

I haven't had much experience with wood working before, so this project is
going to be a fun challenge.

## Day 0: Ordering Parts

It is possible to order a full kit that includes the cabinet pre-cut, and only
requires gluing together. This saves a lot of time and effort.

However, I live in New Zealand, and shipping costs a lot. Especially when it's
large and heavy (like a flat-pack kit of 3/8" MDF board).

So, I decided to build the kit myself. At the time of writing this, I've
spent more on tools then it would have cost me to just order the pre-cut
boards, but I feel like I've learnt more. Also, if I ever decide to make
another speaker in the future, I'll only need to purchase the wood.

I ordered most of the parts from [Parts Express](http://www.parts-express.com).
However, they didn't have the model of tweeter I needed in stock, so I ordered
that from [The Loudspeaker
Kit](http://www.theloudspeakerkit.com/dayton-audio-nd20fa-6-3-4-neodymium-dome-tweeter).
They also didn't have any 10uf non-polarised electrolytic capacitors in stock,
so I picked those up from my local [Jaycar](http://www.jaycar.co.nz/p/RY6908).

## Day 1: Planning

![Paul Carmody's original design plans](/assets/osmtm/plans.jpg)

There are cabinet design plans for 1/2" and 3/4" MDF. However, I only have
access to 18mm MDF, which is a just a millimeter thinner than 3/4". In order to
maintain the same internal volume, I calcluated my own sizes.

Internal dimensions:

- 368mm high
- 114mm wide
- 216mm deep

External dimensions (with 18mm MDF):

- 404mm high
- 150mm wide
- 252mm deep

I used the 2D cutting optimizer at
[optimalon.com](http://optimalon.com/online_cut_optimizer.htm) to plan out what size MDF
boards I would need to purchase. I ended choosing 2x 1800x300x18 boards.

I wanted to rebate the edges of the boards so they join together nicely. I did
plenty of sketches to figure out what cuts I needed to make.

[![](/assets/osmtm/planning-1.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/planning-1.jpg)

I used SketchUp to double check that I had all the dimensions correct and that
my rebate joins were the right size.

## Day 2: Cutting

I started by roughly cutting the boards in half using a circular saw.

I, with help from Dad, used a radial-arm saw to cut the boards into the correct
dimensions. We made sure the saw was cutting at 90Ëš by doing a few cuts on a
bit of scrap.

It took a while to make all the cuts. The front, back, and sides, which were
just a little bit longer than what the saw could reach, needed to be spun
around to finish off the cut.

## Day 3: The Router

I spent the morning shopping for a Router and the necessary cutting bits.

I needed a router to cut the holes for midwoofer and tweeter, as well as to
rebate the edges.

I ended purchasing the Black & Decker KW900EKA Plunge Router, as well as an
18mm straight cutter, a flush trim cutter, and a 10mm rebate cutter.

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-2.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-2.jpg))

I used the flush trim cutter to clean up any inconsistances between the tops,
bottoms, sides and backs.

The 10mm rebate cutter was also used to cut a 10x8mm rebate on the side boards.
I also needed to cut an 8x8mm rebate, but at that time I hadn't figured out how
I was going to do that.

## Day 4: More Routing

I needed to cut an 8mm rebate with only a 10mm rebate cutter, so I made a
simple jig for the router to slide across, at the just the right distance. It
was a bit slow to setup, but it worked ok.

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-3.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-3.jpg)

I then needed to cut a channel in the side and back panels to hold the brace. I
used the included fence attachment to cut a parallel 18mm groove.

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-4.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-4.jpg)

All the panels laid out:

[![](/assets/osmtm/router-5.jpg)](/assets/osmtm/full/router-5.jpg)

I fitted all the panels together (without glue), just to check that I hadn't
made any mistakes with the measurements. Overall I was quite impressed, though
it was wider by about 1.5mm than I had planned for, so I'm going to measure
everything and find out what I need to trim down.
