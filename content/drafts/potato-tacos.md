One of my new years resolutions was to make dinner once a week because knowing how to cook will probably be useful one day. I'll try to make something which I've never made before and document it here, considering I write very rarely. Today I did a quick search and I decided to make [Potato Tacos](http://www.thekitchn.com/easy-weeknight-dinner-potato-t-104274).

I didn't have a number of the ingredients listed so I decided to substitute the peppers, celery, corn, lime and cilantro for courgette, mushrooms, lemon (which I forgot to add to the dish) and basil. **I would also highly recommend doubling the recipe** as I only managed to make eight under-filled tacos, not the ten that it asked for.

It was relatively straightforward to make - I just had to fry the potatoes, then the other vegetables separately. Afterwards I just wiped the frying pan I was using and then used it to heat up the tortillas. The recipe asks for  the peppers to be roasted but I felt that it was a bit of a waste to heat up the oven for something that little. Instead, I fried the courgettes which I used as a substitute and it was still delicious.

The final result was absolutely delicious and I would definitely make it again. I just feel that the recipe doesn't allow for enough and it's a very good idea to double it if you want to make the full ten. The whole process took just under an hour and I would highly recommend trying it out.
