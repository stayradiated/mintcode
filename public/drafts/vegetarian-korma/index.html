  <p>Last week I forgot to post about what I made, but I basically threw a bunch of vegetables into a wok, added a bit of soy sauce and stock and made something that resembled stir fry vegetables. This week I actually decided to bother with a <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Vegetarian-Korma/Detail.aspx">recipe</a> and following it properly.</p>

</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t substitute many ingredients this time round - just the heavy cream with coconut cream and the tomato sauce for chopped tomatoes. I recommend ensuring that the carrot and potato is fully cooked before adding the sauce but other than that, I didn&rsquo;t have any problems with this recipe.</p>

<p>Overall, the Korma is probably my favorite thing I&rsquo;ve made so far. It took me just over an hour to make and my sister didn&rsquo;t disregard it immediately due to its lack of meat. I don&rsquo;t have anything against meat, except that it requires more cleaning up. Like all the things I&rsquo;ve made so far, I highly recommend this dish.</p>
