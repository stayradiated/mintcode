- **Client:** John Paul College
- **Date:** June 2014 to January 2015
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Sass, HTML, PHP

A website I built for John Paul College, Rotorua.

It's powered by the [SilverStripe CMS](http://www.silverstripe.org/) and written in PHP, JavaScript, and Sass.

Features include:

- a dynamically updating event calendar, with the data being pulled from
their KAMAR portal.
- several custom landing pages for international students.
- search, photo gallery, image sliders, etc.
