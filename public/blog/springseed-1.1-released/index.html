  <p>We&rsquo;ve been working on Springseed for the last couple of months and we&rsquo;re excited to announce a new release. We&rsquo;ve made it even easier to organize your notes with the option of categories for your notebooks and support for drag and drop. We&rsquo;ve changed a lot behind the scenes to improve performance &amp; sync reliablilty as well as fixing a large number of issues present in the last release.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re really excited about Springseed and we would love it if you checked it out. If Springseed is already installed, you can get the latest version from the update manager but there may be a &ldquo;Package is unsigned error&rdquo;. You can either dismiss this, or get the app from out website. If you don&rsquo;t already have Springseed, it&rsquo;s available for Ubuntu 12.04 and later from <a href="http://getspringseed.com">getspringseed.com</a>.</p>
