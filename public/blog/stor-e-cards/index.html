  <p>I&rsquo;ve been helping with building a web  service for the last few months. This site, Stor-E-Cards is a unique take on the traditional greeting card, as each card has the link to a story online inside. I think it&rsquo;s pretty neat and they are definitely nicer than E-Cards because due the product being a real physical card. In a way, it bridges the physical and digital worlds.</p>

</p>

<p>The site was orignally built with PHP &amp; MySQL, but the current version uses Ruby on Rails &amp; PostgreSQL. It&rsquo;s only going to get better as we add more new cards and features.</p>

<p>A lot of the stories are pretty cool and it is worth having a look at. Cards are bought from the site and they&rsquo;re currently $7.99 NZD with free worldwide shipping.</p>
