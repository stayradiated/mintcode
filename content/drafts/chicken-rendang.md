I don't really like chicken, but there was a bunch of chicken that needed to be used so I just made the [same as last week](/beef-rendang/). The recipe didn't really change at all, and while it turned out to be ok, it was certanily better with the beef.

I also managed to mistake the very spicy chili from the market for the very mild chili that grows in the garden. Needless to say, it was a bit on the hot side. While the dish today was still delicious, I wouldn't recommend chicken.
