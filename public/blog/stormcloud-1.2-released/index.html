<p>Stormcloud has finally made it into the Ubuntu Software Center (seriously, it was finished like 3 weeks ago). While it&rsquo;s still open source, pre-built packages are available exclusively through the Ubuntu Software Center. It&rsquo;s $2.99 and totally worth it.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-new:2239db737d5ca4a31af23e2dee0b11a2">What&rsquo;s new?</h2>

<p>Everything. Stormcloud underwent a rewrite. It looks and feels pretty similar but it now has support for multiple locations, chameleonic backgrounds (unity only), credits, touch screen support and many more animations.</p>

<p>On the technical side of things, Stormcloud now uses node-webkit rather than GTKWebkit. This is so there are hardware accelerated animations and the smoothest experience possible. The only downside is that it adds a lot to the download size.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-2-99:2239db737d5ca4a31af23e2dee0b11a2">Why is it $2.99?</h2>

<p>Stormcloud 1.1 was free. If you want Stormcloud 1.2 for free, you can download it off <a href="https://github.com/consindo/stormcloud">Github</a>. I&rsquo;m charging a small fee because I not only want to test how well the Software Center monetizes but earning some money will encourage me to make Stormcloud even more excellent.</p>

<p>You can get Stormcloud from the <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/stormcloud/">Ubuntu Software Center</a>.</p>
