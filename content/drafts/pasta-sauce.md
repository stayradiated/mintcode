Many recipes are advertised as only taking 15-30 minutes to prepare but they often use obscure ingredients. The [recipe I was going to make today](http://bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/412625/superveg-pasta) wasn't obscure, but I still didn't have most of the ingredients. Instead, I just made my own Pasta Sauce.

It's pretty fast and simple to make. I used carrot, garlic, onions and peppers but you can really substitute those ingredients for whatever you want. I just threw them all into a saucepan and then added a can of chopped tomatoes and two cups of chicken stock. I then just used the sauce to top some pasta that I was making at the same time.

This recipe is fantastic. It works with everything, tastes delicious and only takes 15-30 minutes to make. If you ever need to make something that's fast, delicious and healthy, you should give this a go.
