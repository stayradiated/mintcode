One of my favourite Asian dishes is Rendang, so I decided to have a shot at making it this week. I used [this recipe from the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/beefrendang_78767) and made the paste from scratch.

I didn't do a lot of ingredient substitution this time around, but I used rump steak rather than stew steak  as it was cheaper. As to not ruin the meat, I only fried the beef in the paste for about ten minutes and then let it sit rather than letting it simmer for two hours. The result was a Rendang that was different to the traditional dishes, but still tender and delicious without the hours of slow cooking.

I didn't make a full Nasi lemak to go alongside the Rendang, but served it with coconut rice and salad. Whilst my dish was a little un-traditional, it still turned out well. I consider Rendang to be one of the most delicious foods in the world and if you've never tried it, it's something you really need to do.
