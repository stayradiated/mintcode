Last week I forgot to post about what I made, but I basically threw a bunch of vegetables into a wok, added a bit of soy sauce and stock and made something that resembled stir fry vegetables. This week I actually decided to bother with a [recipe](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Vegetarian-Korma/Detail.aspx) and following it properly.

I didn't substitute many ingredients this time round - just the heavy cream with coconut cream and the tomato sauce for chopped tomatoes. I recommend ensuring that the carrot and potato is fully cooked before adding the sauce but other than that, I didn't have any problems with this recipe.

Overall, the Korma is probably my favorite thing I've made so far. It took me just over an hour to make and my sister didn't disregard it immediately due to its lack of meat. I don't have anything against meat, except that it requires more cleaning up. Like all the things I've made so far, I highly recommend this dish.
