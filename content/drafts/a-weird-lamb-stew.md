I tried making Moroccan Lamb, but I ended up making a weird lamb stew. The problem was that I had expensive lamb, and in order not to ruin it, I couldn't slow cook it. I ended up just using all the ingredients from a number of [different recipes](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/moroccan-lamb-tagine-10000000600610/) and then only cooking it for around 10 minutes.

Like normal moroccan lamb, I ended up making some couscous to go along with it. And it did end tasting pretty good, but just not like Moroccan Lamb.

Meat is hard. I'm going back to cooking vegetarian next week.
