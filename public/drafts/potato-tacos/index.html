  <h1 class='title'>Potato Tacos</h1>

  <p>One of my new years resolutions was to make dinner once a week because knowing how to cook will probably be useful one day. I&rsquo;ll try to make something which I&rsquo;ve never made before and document it here, considering I write very rarely. Today I did a quick search and I decided to make <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/easy-weeknight-dinner-potato-t-104274">Potato Tacos</a>.</p>

(Please excuse the phone photography)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a number of the ingredients listed so I decided to substitute the peppers, celery, corn, lime and cilantro for courgette, mushrooms, lemon (which I forgot to add to the dish) and basil. <strong>I would also highly recommend doubling the recipe</strong> as I only managed to make eight under-filled tacos, not the ten that it asked for.</p>

</p>

<p>It was relatively straightforward to make - I just had to fry the potatoes, then the other vegetables separately. Afterwards I just wiped the frying pan I was using and then used it to heat up the tortillas. The recipe asks for  the peppers to be roasted but I felt that it was a bit of a waste to heat up the oven for something that little. Instead, I fried the courgettes which I used as a substitute and it was still delicious.</p>

</p>

<p>The final result was absolutely delicious and I would definitely make it again. I just feel that the recipe doesn&rsquo;t allow for enough and it&rsquo;s a very good idea to double it if you want to make the full ten. The whole process took just under an hour and I would highly recommend trying it out.</p>
