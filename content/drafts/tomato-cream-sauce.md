I needed something quick and easy to make, so I decided to make something similar to the [pasta sauce](/pasta-sauce/) I had made in the past. I quickly found this recipe for [tomato cream sauce](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/tomato-cream-sauce-for-pasta/) and started preparing it.

Like the other pasta sauce, you can really put anything you like in it. I ended up using fresh tomatoes as opposed to canned tomatoes, and turned out fine. I also added some bacon, because bacon is delicious. It took about half an hour total to prepare and cook everything, so this recipe is another good and tasty option if you need some food quickly.
