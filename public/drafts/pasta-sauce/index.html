  <p>Many recipes are advertised as only taking 15-30 minutes to prepare but they often use obscure ingredients. The <a href="http://bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/412625/superveg-pasta">recipe I was going to make today</a> wasn&rsquo;t obscure, but I still didn&rsquo;t have most of the ingredients. Instead, I just made my own Pasta Sauce.</p>

</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty fast and simple to make. I used carrot, garlic, onions and peppers but you can really substitute those ingredients for whatever you want. I just threw them all into a saucepan and then added a can of chopped tomatoes and two cups of chicken stock. I then just used the sauce to top some pasta that I was making at the same time.</p>

<p>This recipe is fantastic. It works with everything, tastes delicious and only takes 15-30 minutes to make. If you ever need to make something that&rsquo;s fast, delicious and healthy, you should give this a go.</p>
