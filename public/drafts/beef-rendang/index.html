  <p>One of my favourite Asian dishes is Rendang, so I decided to have a shot at making it this week. I used <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/beefrendang_78767">this recipe from the BBC</a> and made the paste from scratch.</p>

</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of ingredient substitution this time around, but I used rump steak rather than stew steak  as it was cheaper. As to not ruin the meat, I only fried the beef in the paste for about ten minutes and then let it sit rather than letting it simmer for two hours. The result was a Rendang that was different to the traditional dishes, but still tender and delicious without the hours of slow cooking.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t make a full Nasi lemak to go alongside the Rendang, but served it with coconut rice and salad. Whilst my dish was a little un-traditional, it still turned out well. I consider Rendang to be one of the most delicious foods in the world and if you&rsquo;ve never tried it, it&rsquo;s something you really need to do.</p>
